2(c):
Now, suppose you are measuring the number of seconds between lightning strikes during a storm, your prior is Gamma(0.1, 1.0), and your data is 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
theta <- seq(0,1,length.out = 1000)

# Data
obs.data <- str(20.9, 69.7, 3.6, 21.8, 21.4, 0.4, 6.7, 10.0)
n <- length(obs.data)
x <- sum(obs.data)

# Prior parameters
a <- 0.1
b <- 1.0 

# Posterior parameter 
plot(theta, dgamma(theta,a + 1 ,b + x),type = "l",
     xlab = "theta",ylab = "")

lines(theta, dgamma(theta,a,b), col = 2, lty = 2)

legend("topright",legend = c("posterior","prior"),lty = c(1,2),col = c(1,2))


```

Plot the prior and posterior p.d.f.s. (Be sure to make your plots on a scale that allows you to clearly see the important features.)
